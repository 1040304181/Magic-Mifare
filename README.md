# Dependencies

* [MFRC522 Arduino Library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)

# Setup

Download the MFRC522 repository as a zip file and extract it into your arduino libraries folder. *For some reason* the official releases don't contain the MFRC522hack and MFRC522debug classes, which we need.

Connecting the RFID module to Arduino is described in "MagicMifare.ino"

# Running

Open the "MagicMifare.ino" in Arduino IDE and upload it to your board. Then open the serial monitor.
